```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,

# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document.
Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents.
For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

````markdown
```{r}`r ''`
summary(cars)
```
````

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

# Best Practices

- **Use a new line for every sentence.** 
This helps with version control—individually changed sentences will be highlighted upon commits (easy to parse) rather than whole paragraphs (nightmare to parse).
    - This formatting is incompatible with a double space after a period.
    Instead, use a single space after a period.
    To replace all double spaces with single spaces, do a find and replace for `".  "` → `". "` 
    Be careful not to blanket remove all double spaces because tabbed bullets have 3 spaces.
- When making numbered (ordered) lists, just use `1. ` for all numbers.
Markdown will make them sequential automatically.
This is helpful if you go back and add additional entries later.

# Software

You can create/edit R Markdown (`.Rmd`) files with the following free software:

- [`Microsoft Visual Studio Code`](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [`RStudio`](https://www.rstudio.com/)

## Microsoft Visual Studio Code

If you use `Visual Studio Code` to create/edit `.Rmd` documents, you can view the source code side-by-side with the markdown Preview (after selecting the code type as `markdown`):
![Visual Studio Code](images/vsCode.png)

## RStudio

When you click the **Knit** button in RStudio, a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor.
Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks.
Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Including Plots

You can embed plots, for example:

````markdown
```{r, echo = FALSE}`r ''`
plot(pressure)
```
````

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Headings

## Subheading

### Subsubheading

#### Subsubsubheading

# Lists

To add another element in a list while preserving the continuity of the list, indent the element four spaces or one tab.

## Unordered Lists

To create an unordered list, add dashes (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+) in front of line items.

- one item
- one item
- one item
    - one more item
    - one more item
    - one more item
        - lower level
            - sub-item 1
            - sub-item 2

## Ordered Lists

1. the first item
    1. test
    1. test
        1. new test
        1. new test
1. the second item
    1. test
    1. test
1. the third item
    - one unordered item
        - subitem
    - one unordered item
1. fourth item
    1. test
    1. test
    1. test

# Code/Syntax Highlighting

To use syntax highlighting to display code without running the code:

```` markdown
```r
summary(cars)
```
````

```r
summary(cars)
```

or

````markdown
```{r, eval = FALSE}`r ''`
summary(cars)
```
````

```{r, eval = FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

or

```` markdown
    summary(cars)
````
which yields:

    summary(cars)

# Math Formulas

Inline:

This is the formula: $x = y + 5$. Solve for $x$.

Separate line:

$$
y = \frac{x}{7} \cdot 4 + 3 \times 2 - 1_{a1}/2^{1c/2} \dots
$$

# Links

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. 
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com>

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

# Footnotes

Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].  

You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.  
  This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
[^note]:
    Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.  
    This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.
