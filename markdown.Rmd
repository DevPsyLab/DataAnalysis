# `R` Markdown {#rMarkdown}

## Overview {#overview}

This is an `R `Markdown document.
Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents.
For more details on using `R` Markdown see https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com (archived at https://perma.cc/4MP3-5RT8)

You can embed an `R` code chunk like this:

````markdown
```{r}`r ''`
summary(cars)
```
````

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

# Lab Wiki {#labWiki}

## Best Practices {#bestPractices}

Adapted from [here](https://github.com/lowepowerlab/protocols/blob/main/markdown_best_practices.md; archived at https://perma.cc/P75L-3UM9):

- **Use a new line for every sentence.** 
This helps with version control—individually changed sentences will be highlighted upon commits (easy to parse) rather than whole paragraphs (nightmare to parse).
    - This formatting is incompatible with a double space after a period.
    Instead, use a single space after a period.
    To replace all double spaces with single spaces, do a find and replace for `".  "` → `". "` 
    Be careful not to blanket remove all double spaces because tabbed bullets have 3 spaces.
- Add protocol entries as links to the parent `.Rmd` file (or to `README.md`)
- Add linked content (e.g., images) to sub-directories
- Use no spaces in file or folder names.
Use a dash (-) instead of a space.
- If you use `Visual Studio Code` to edit the Lab Wiki, you can view the source code side-by-side with the markdown Preview (after selecting the code type as `markdown`):
![Visual Studio Code](images/vsCode.png)
- When making numbered (ordered) lists, just use `1. ` for all numbers.
Markdown will make them sequential automatically.
This is helpful if you go back and add additional entries later.
- Use `"[XXX]"` to indicate an area that needs editing.
This will allow the lab to `CTRL+F` for `"[XXX]"` and find areas that need editing.
- To update the list of `R` packages that are installed for running the `.Rmd` files, update the `DESCRIPTION` file.
- When adding a link to an external (non-lab) URL, add both the original link and the [perma.cc](https://perma.cc) link to prevent link rot (websites will go offline and disappear over time).
For example: http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Scatterplots_(ggplot2)/ (archived at https://perma.cc/N4TL-JQS4)
You can get a [perma.cc](https://perma.cc) account through the UI Libraries.

## Updating {#updateWiki}

To update the lab wiki, perform the following steps:

1. (Perform this step if you do not already have the the [LabWiki `GitHub` repo](https://github.com/DevPsyLab/LabWiki) on your local machine:) Clone the `GitHub` repo to your local machine.
1. Fetch the latest version of the repo.
It is important to do this to make sure you have the latest version locally before making any changes.
1. Edit the relevant `.Rmd` files using `RStudio` or `Visual Studio Code`.
1. Preview the wiki before you commit changes to the site; create the `.html` files locally (in a folder called `_site`) by running the following command:
   - `rmarkdown::render_site()`
1. If the `.html` files look correct, commit the changes.
1. Push the changes to the `GitHub` repo.
After pushing the changes to the `GitHub` repo, `GitHub Actions` will automatically re-run the code and deploy the updated website, assuming there were no errors.
You can track the workflow for errors here: https://github.com/DevPsyLab/LabWiki/actions.

For more information about the `rmarkdown` package that was used to generate the site, see the following links:

- https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html (archived at https://perma.cc/5C4T-SY9V)
- https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html (archived at https://perma.cc/WQS5-KH4S)

# Software {#software}

You can create/edit `R` Markdown (`.Rmd`) files with the following free software:

- [`Microsoft Visual Studio Code`](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- [`RStudio`](https://www.rstudio.com)

## Microsoft Visual Studio Code {#vsCode}

If you use `Visual Studio Code` to create/edit `.Rmd` documents, you can view the source code side-by-side with the markdown Preview (after selecting the code type as `markdown`):
![Visual Studio Code](images/vsCode.png)

## RStudio {#rstudio}

### Creating a Code Chunk {#createCodeChunk}

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

### Running a Code Chunk {#runCodeChunk}

You can execute a code chunk in an `R` Markdown Notebook by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.
To run more than one code chunk, you have several options:

- click the *Run* button within the chunks you want to run
- select "Run All Chunks Above"
- select "Run All Chunks Below"
- select "Run All"

### Creating the HTML Output {#htmlOutput}

When you click the **Knit** button, a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded `R `code chunks within the document.

When you save the computational notebook (`.Rmd`), an HTML (`.html`) file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor.
Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any `R` code chunks.
Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Computational Notebook {#computationalNotebook}

## General Info {#general}

You can use an `R` Markdown Notebook to create a computational notebook.
For more information on the value of computational notebooks, see the article titled "[The Scientific Paper Is Obsolete](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-scientific-paper-is-obsolete/556676/; archived at https://perma.cc/XHW4-K89V)".
For more information about how to create `R` Notebooks, see here:

https://garrettgman.github.io/rmarkdown/r_notebooks (archived at https://perma.cc/L78P-G73Z)

https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/notebook.html (archived at https://perma.cc/P5YT-395F)

## Files {#files}

Consistent with the [Petersen Lab template](https://research-git.uiowa.edu/PetersenLab/Template) for how to structure your repo, you should have two computational notebooks: 1) a "Prepare Data" script (`prepareData.Rmd`) and 2) a "Computational Notebook" script (`computationalNotebook.Rmd`).
The "Prepare Data" script is used to update the data file by re-exporting, merging, re-running calculations, etc.
This script should be separate from the "Computational Notebook" file that is used for running analyses on the data.
Every time you run the "Computational Notebook" file with the exact same data, you should get the exact same findings (i.e., reproducibility).
Thus, we keep the "Prepare Data script" separate from the "Computational Notebook" file so that you update the data only when you intend to.

## Structure {#structure}

When creating a computational notebook, follow the structure of the computational notebooks in the [Petersen Lab template](https://research-git.uiowa.edu/PetersenLab/Template).
To create a computational notebook, create a `.Rmd` file with the following `YAML` header at the top of the file:

```yaml
---
title: "INSERT TITLE"
author: "INSERT AUTHOR NAME(S)"
date: "`r knitr::inline_expr("format(Sys.time(), '%d %B, %Y')")`"
output: 
  html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_depth: 4
    toc_float: true
    number_sections: true
    code_folding: show
    df_print: paged
---
```

If this is your "Computational Notebook" script, include the following as the first code chunk:

````markdown
```{r setup, include = FALSE}`r ''`
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = TRUE, # print code
  error = TRUE # do not interrupt in case of errors
)

# Use for higher quality figures on Windows devices
trace(grDevices::png, quote({
  if (missing(type) && missing(antialias)) {
    type <- "cairo-png"
    antialias <- "subpixel"
  }
}), print = FALSE)
```
````

If this is your "Prepare Data" script, include the following as the first code chunk:

````markdown
```{r setup, include = FALSE}`r ''`
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = TRUE # print code
)
```
````
Then, include whatever text and/or code chunks.

## Creating CSS Commands {#css}

Personalized commands can be created in Visual Code through the CSS file within the Wiki folder.
To create a new CSS commands:

1. In Visual Studio Code, open the `css` tab within the Wiki Folder

1. Open the `# srs.css` file under the `css` tab

1. Enter in your personalized command according to the following structure:

```
COMMAND_NAME {
  command-specification1: value1;
  command-specification2: value2;
  command-specification3: value3;
  quotes: """ """ "‘" "'";
}
```

1. The following specifications may be added to your command:
   - `font-size`: Value = `percentage`
      - e.g., `font-size: 150%`
   - `font-style`: Value = `bold`, `italic`, `underline`
      - e.g., `font-style: bold`, `font-style: italic`
   - `color`: Value = `color name` or `color code`
      - e.g., `color: green`, `color: #0e6b1c`
   - To edit the command to add quotations, include the following *after* the end bracket of the command: 
      ```
      COMMAND_NAME:before { content: open-quote; }
      COMMAND_NAME:after  { content: close-quote; }
      ```
1. An example of a command is presented here:

```
example {
  font-size: 150%;
  font-style: italic;
  color:#C800FC;
  quotes: """ """ "‘" "'";
}
example:before { content: open-quote; }
example:after  { content: close-quote; }
```

# `rmarkdown`/`Quarto` Website using `GitHub Actions` {#website}

## Steps to Create {#websiteSteps}

1. Create a new `GitHub` repo under the [DevPsyLab organization](https://github.com/DevPsyLab) in GitHub
1. Create the repository using one of the following templates:
    - `rmarkdown`: https://github.com/DevPsyLab/MarkdownWebsite
        - for local rendering: https://github.com/DevPsyLab/MarkdownWebsite-RenderLocal
    - `Quarto`: https://github.com/DevPsyLab/QuartoWebsite
        - for local rendering: https://github.com/DevPsyLab/QuartoWebsite-RenderLocal

If you do not create the repository from a template, the steps for creating the repo manually are below:

1. Create a `README.md` file
    - this is the file that people see when navigating to the repo
1. Add a `.gitignore` file
    - this file says what file types to ignore and not add to the repo
1. Create a new branch called `gh-pages`
1. Delete all files in the `gh-pages` branch
1. Switch back the main branch of the repo, and add the following contents (to the main branch, **not** to the `gh-pages` branch):
    - `/.github/workflows/deploy_markdown.yml` file
        - this file tells `GitHub Actions` was steps to run
        - add the following contents to the file:
            - if using `rmarkdown`:
                - if the website is intended to be public: https://github.com/DevPsyLab/LabWiki/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy_rmarkdown.yml
                - if the website is intended to be private: https://github.com/DevPsyLab/SchoolReadinessStudy/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy_rmarkdown.yml
            - if using `Quarto`:
                - if the website is intended to be public: https://github.com/DevPsyLab/QuartoWebsite/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish.yml
                - if the website is intended to be private: https://github.com/DevPsyLab/QuartoWebsite-RenderLocal/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish.yml
    - `YAML` file—this file creates the navbar:
        - if using `rmarkdown`:
            - `_site.yml` file
        - if using `Quarto`:
            - `_quarto.yml` file
    - `LICENSE` file
        - this file is the license
    - `DESCRIPTION` file
        - this file tells `GitHub Actions` what `R` packages to install
1. Add each `.Rmd` file (for `rmarkdown`) or `.qmd` file (for `Quarto`)
1. Add folders for the [`font`](https://github.com/DevPsyLab/LabWiki/tree/main/font), [`images`](https://github.com/DevPsyLab/LabWiki/tree/main/images), and [`includes`](https://github.com/DevPsyLab/LabWiki/tree/main/includes)
    - `includes` contains `css` files, javascript files, footers, and Google Analytics
1. If the `rmarkdown` website is intended to be public, create a new Google Analytics property, and replace the URL and gtag in the `google_analytics.html` file
1. Commit the repo to `GitHub`
1. To deploy the website on `GitHub Pages`:
    1. Make the repo public (Settings > General > Change Visibility)
    1. Activate `GitHub Pages` (Settings > Pages)
        - Source: "Deploy from a Branch"
        - Branch: `gh-pages/root`
        - Click "Save"
    1. Make sure "Read and write permissions" are enabled in Settings -> Actions -> General -> Workflow permissions

## Quarto Manuscripts

- Quarto Journal Templates: https://github.com/quarto-journals

Example:

- https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel/indo-rct
    - https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/indo-rct/

To prevent code from re-running unless code is altered:

```yaml
execute:
    freeze: auto
```

## Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

If you get the following error in `GitHub Actions`:

```
remote: Permission to GITHUB_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git denied to github-actions[bot].
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/GITHUB_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
```

Check if "Read and write permissions" are enabled in Settings -> Actions -> General -> Workflow permissions:

# Including Plots {#plots}

You can embed plots, for example:

````markdown
```{r, echo = FALSE}`r ''`
plot(pressure)
```
````

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the `R` code that generated the plot.

# Headings {#headings}

## Subheading {#subheading}

### Subsubheading {#subsubheading}

```
# Headings {#heading-label1}

## Subheading {#heading-label2}

#### Subsubsubheading {#heading-label4}
```

# Lists {#lists}

To add another element in a list while preserving the continuity of the list, indent the element four spaces or one tab.

## Unordered Lists {#unorderedLists}

To create an unordered list, add a dash (-) in front of line items.
Adding an asterisk (*) or plus sign (+) in front of line items will also create an unordered list; however, the lab convention is to use dashes for unordered lists.
We use asterisks for [adding emphasis to text](#emphasis).

````markdown

# Video formatting for Wiki {#videoFormatting}

[Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr) can be used to lower video quality, and convert files to `.mp4` format, in order for them to be incorporated into the wiki.
It is important to lower the quality (i.e., file size) of videos so that we do not exceed the 1gb file size limit on any given repo.

## Lowering File Size {#lowerFileSize}

- Open Handbrake and drag and drop the video that you would like to lower the file size of.
- Select the `video` tab and lower the `Constant Quality` to `30`, and the `Framerate (FPS):` to `20`
   - We have found this lowers file size, but saves video quality
