# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document.
Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents.
For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

````markdown
```{r}`r ''`
summary(cars)
```
````

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

# Lab Wiki

## Best Practices

Adapted from [here](https://github.com/lowepowerlab/protocols/blob/main/markdown_best_practices.md):

- **Use a new line for every sentence.** 
This helps with version control—individually changed sentences will be highlighted upon commits (easy to parse) rather than whole paragraphs (nightmare to parse).
    - This formatting is incompatible with a double space after a period.
    Instead, use a single space after a period.
    To replace all double spaces with single spaces, do a find and replace for `".  "` → `". "` 
    Be careful not to blanket remove all double spaces because tabbed bullets have 3 spaces.
- Add protocol entries as links to the parent `.Rmd` file (or to `README.md`)
- Add linked content (e.g., images) to sub-directories
- Use no spaces in file or folder names.
Use a dash (-) instead of a space.
- If you use `Visual Studio Code` to edit the Lab Wiki, you can view the source code side-by-side with the markdown Preview (after selecting the code type as `markdown`):
![Visual Studio Code](images/vsCode.png)
- When making numbered (ordered) lists, just use `1. ` for all numbers.
Markdown will make them sequential automatically.
This is helpful if you go back and add additional entries later.
- Use `"[XXX]"` to indicate an area that needs editing.
This will allow the lab to `CTRL+F` for `"[XXX]"` and find areas that need editing.
- To update the list of `R` packages that are installed for running the `.Rmd` files, update the `DESCRIPTION` file.

## Updating

To update the lab wiki, perform the following steps:

1. (Perform this step if you do not already have the the [LabWiki `GitHub` repo](https://github.com/DevPsyLab/LabWiki) on your local machine:) Clone the `GitHub` repo to your local machine.
1. Fetch the latest version of the repo.
It is important to do this to make sure you have the latest version locally before making any changes.
1. Edit the relevant `.Rmd` files using `RStudio` or `Visual Studio Code`.
1. Preview the wiki before you commit changes to the site; create the `.html` files locally (in a folder called `_site`) by running the following command:
   - `rmarkdown::render_site()`
1. If the `.html` files look correct, commit the changes.
1. Push the changes to the `GitHub` repo.
After pushing the changes to the `GitHub` repo, `GitHub Actions` will automatically re-run the code and deploy the updated website, assuming there were no errors.
You can track the workflow for errors here: https://github.com/DevPsyLab/LabWiki/actions.

For more information about the `rmarkdown` package that was used to generate the site, see the following links:

- https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html
- https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html



# Software

You can create/edit R Markdown (`.Rmd`) files with the following free software:

- [`Microsoft Visual Studio Code`](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- [`RStudio`](https://www.rstudio.com)

## Microsoft Visual Studio Code

If you use `Visual Studio Code` to create/edit `.Rmd` documents, you can view the source code side-by-side with the markdown Preview (after selecting the code type as `markdown`):
![Visual Studio Code](images/vsCode.png)

## RStudio

### Creating a Code Chunk

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

### Running a Code Chunk

You can execute a code chunk in an R Markdown Notebook by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.
To run more than one code chunk, you have several options:

- click the *Run* button within the chunks you want to run
- select "Run All Chunks Above"
- select "Run All Chunks Below"
- select "Run All"

### Creating the HTML Output

When you click the **Knit** button, a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

When you save the computational notebook (`.Rmd`), an HTML (`.html`) file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor.
Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks.
Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Computational Notebook {#computationalNotebook}

## General Info

You can use an R Markdown Notebook to create a computational notebook.
For more information on the value of computational notebooks, see the article titled "[The Scientific Paper Is Obsolete](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-scientific-paper-is-obsolete/556676/)".
For more information about how to create R Notebooks, see here:

https://garrettgman.github.io/rmarkdown/r_notebooks

https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/notebook.html

## Files

Consistent with the [Petersen Lab template](https://research-git.uiowa.edu/PetersenLab/Template) for how to structure your repo, you should have two computational notebooks: 1) a "Prepare Data" script (`prepareData.Rmd`) and 2) a "Computational Notebook" script (`computationalNotebook.Rmd`).
The "Prepare Data" script is used to update the data file by re-exporting, merging, re-running calculations, etc.
This script should be separate from the "Computational Notebook" file that is used for running analyses on the data.
Every time you run the "Computational Notebook" file with the exact same data, you should get the exact same findings (i.e., reproducibility).
Thus, we keep the "Prepare Data script" separate from the "Computational Notebook" file so that you update the data only when you intend to.

## Structure

When creating a computational notebook, follow the structure of the computational notebooks in the [Petersen Lab template](https://research-git.uiowa.edu/PetersenLab/Template).
To create a computational notebook, create a `.Rmd` file with the following `YAML` header at the top of the file:

```yaml
---
title: "INSERT TITLE"
author: "INSERT AUTHOR NAME(S)"
date: "`r knitr::inline_expr("format(Sys.time(), '%d %B, %Y')")`"
output: 
  html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_depth: 4
    toc_float: true
    number_sections: true
    code_folding: show
    df_print: paged
---
```

If this is your "Computational Notebook" script, include the following as the first code chunk:

````markdown
```{r setup, include = FALSE}`r ''`
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = TRUE, # print code
  error = TRUE # do not interrupt in case of errors
)

# Use for higher quality figures on Windows devices
trace(grDevices::png, quote({
  if (missing(type) && missing(antialias)) {
    type <- "cairo-png"
    antialias <- "subpixel"
  }
}), print = FALSE)
```
````

If this is your "Prepare Data" script, include the following as the first code chunk:

````markdown
```{r setup, include = FALSE}`r ''`
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = TRUE # print code
)
```
````
Then, include whatever text and/or code chunks.

# Steps to Create `rmarkdown` Website using GitHub Actions

1. Create a new GitHub repo under the [DevPsyLab organization](https://github.com/DevPsyLab) in GitHub
1. Create a `README.md` file
    - this is the file that people see when navigating to the repo
1. Add a `.gitignore` file
    - this file says what file types to ignore and not add to the repo
1. Create a new branch called `gh-pages`
1. Delete all files in the `gh-pages` branch
1. In your [GitHub account settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens), Create a "Personal Access Token" called `EMAIL` (if it doesn't already exist)
    - Settings > Developer Settings > Personal access tokens
    - make sure to save the contents of the personal access token somewhere safe (you will need it later)
1. In the repo settings, add a secret called `EMAIL`, and add the Personal Access Token (that you created in the previous step)
    - Settings > Secrets > Actions > New repository secret
    - Name: `EMAIL`
    - Value: [INSERT PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN]
1. To the repo, add the following contents:
    - [`/.github/workflows/deploy_markdown.yml`](https://github.com/DevPsyLab/LabWiki/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy_rmarkdown.yml) file
        - this file tells GitHub Actions was steps to run
    - `_site.yml` file
        - this file creates the navbar
    - `LICENSE` file
        - this file is the license
    - `DESCRIPTION` file
        - this file tells GitHub Actions what `R` packages to install
1. Add each `.Rmd` file
1. Add folders for the [`font`](https://github.com/DevPsyLab/LabWiki/tree/main/font), [`images`](https://github.com/DevPsyLab/LabWiki/tree/main/images), and [`includes`](https://github.com/DevPsyLab/LabWiki/tree/main/includes)
    - `includes` contains `css` files, javascript files, footers, and Google Analytics
1. Create a new Google Analytics property, and replace the URL and gtag in the `google_analytics.html` file
1. Commit the repo to GitHub

# Including Plots

You can embed plots, for example:

````markdown
```{r, echo = FALSE}`r ''`
plot(pressure)
```
````

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Headings Examples {#headings}
```r
# Headings {#headings}

# Lists

To add another element in a list while preserving the continuity of the list, indent the element four spaces or one tab.

## Unordered Lists

To create an unordered list, add dashes (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+) in front of line items.

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].  

You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

[^1]: My reference.

  This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
[^note]:
    Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.

# Embedding a Picture

```markdown
![Insert Figure Caption here](Insert image filename and location here)
```

For instance:

```markdown
![Visual Studio Code](images/vsCode.png)
```

# Embedding a Video

* First, make sure the repository is configured for large file storage.
Follow the instructions [here](git.html#gitLfs) to do so.

* A helpful example repository for embedding videos can be found [here](https://github.com/PLAY-behaviorome/PLAY-project.org/blob/master/collection_homevisit.Rmd)

```markdown
<video width="100%" controls="" preload="none"> #video settings
<source src="images/lv2-saving-procedures.mp4" type="video/mp4"> #location and type of video

# Converting Word Documents to Markdown

The process of converting word documents to Markdown is aided by having knowledge of the [best practices](#bestPractices) steps.
Furthermore, read the section on [Visual Studio Code](https://devpsylab.github.io/LabWiki/manual.html#12_Lab_Wiki) to become familiar with.

To convert documents, follow these steps:

1. Open both word doc to be converted and new markdown document
1. Copy and paste the text to convert
1. Follow the [best practices](#bestPractices) to convert the document to Markdown format
   *  For example, in the manuals for the School Readiness Study, each [new header](#headings) should denote a new task
1. **Importantly, each sentence will correspond to one line in markdown.**
To convert sentences out of paragraph form: 
   * Press `Ctrl f`
   * search `. `
   * Next, click the arrow on the left side of the search window to open up the replace function in Visual Studio Code.
   * The goal of this process is to create one sentence per line.
   Creating one sentence per line.
   By using one sentence for line, changes can be tracked easier.
   * In the `Replace` line, type `Ctrl Enter` to create a new line.
   * Go through each find to determine if a new line should be created.
**Do not replace all**.
Bulleted lists may also contain a `. ` that should not be removed.
