# Accessing ABCD Data

## Connecting to the RRDS

To access ABCD data, you need to access an RRDS.

1. Create an RRDS Account: https://its.uiowa.edu/services/research-remote-desktop-service 
1. Once your account is approved, contact PBS IT to set up a remote desktop profile  (???)
1. Connect to the RRDS: https://its.uiowa.edu/services/research-remote-desktop-service/connecting-research-remote-desktop-services-rrds 
    - Instructions for Windows: https://its.uiowa.edu/services/research-remote-desktop-service/connecting-rrds-using-windows-pc
    - Instructions for Mac: https://its.uiowa.edu/services/research-remote-desktop-service/connecting-rrds-using-mac
1. Log in to the RRDS using your HawkID and password
1. The RRDS is mapped to an LSS Drive containing the ABCD data.

## Connecting to the Share

Please contact Dr. Petersen to receive the network path for the ABCD LSS.

## Access Management

[XXX]

Dr. Petersen can grant or revoke access to the share: https://iam.uiowa.edu/access
- Instructions for granting or revoking access: https://its.uiowa.edu/support/article/118771
- Delegate management of share access: https://its.uiowa.edu/support/article/119191

A few notes:
- When granting someone Read/Write or Read Only permissions and search for their name or ID, you may see both a HealthcareID and HawkID listed, <mark>select their HawkID</mark>.
- Changes take about an hour to propagate through Argon and will not be reflected in existing sessions.
- Changes are immediately reflected for SMB connections, however, users may have to remap/remount the volume or log out then back in for Windows/MacOS to be happy.

# LSS Structure

The LSS should not be accessed on your local computer. 
The LSS should **only** be accessed through the RRDS.
The main folder within the LSS is: `ABCD Study`

## Analyses Projects
- `Analyses Projects > PetersenLab` contains user folders for anyone working on projects with the ABCD data.
    1. Create a folder with your HawkID as the folder name
    1. Create a subfolder for your specific project
    1. Follow [Petersen Lab template](https://research-git.uiowa.edu/PetersenLab/Template) for structuring your project folder

## Data

The folder `Data > Version 6.0` contains tabulated ABCD data.

Imaging data, wearables data, and concatenated data are available for download [here](https://nbdc-datashare.lassoinformatics.com/)

- [XXX] need instructions for accessing this
- NOTE: The file sizes for these data exceed the capacity of our LSS

`01-Raw` contains the raw ABCD data files that should not be altered.

`02-Processed` contains scored measures and other cleaned data for universal use.

## File types
- JSON files: data dictionary/codebook files
- Parquet files: columnar structured data (efficient for storage, can be used with the Arrow package in R)
- TSV files: tab-separated value data files

# Version Control

[XXX] TBD
