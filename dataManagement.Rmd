```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      error = TRUE,
                      comment = "",
                      class.source = "fold-show")
```

# Import data

Importing data takes syntax of the following form for `.csv` files:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
data <- read.csv("filepath/filename.csv")
```

Note: it is important to use forward slashes ("/") rather than backslashes ("\\") when specifying filepaths in `R`.

Below, I import a `.csv` file and save it into an object called `mydata` (you could call this object whatever you want):

```{r}
mydata <- read.csv("https://osf.io/s6wrm/download")
```

Importing data takes syntax of the following form for `.RData` files:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
load("filepath/filename.RData")
```

# Save data

Saving data takes syntax of the following form for `.csv` files:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
write.csv(object, file = "filepath/filename.csv")
```

For example:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
write.csv(mydata, file = "mydata.csv")
```

Saving data takes syntax of the following form for `.RData` files:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
save(object, file = "filepath/filename.RData")
```

# Use lab functions

To use lab functions, first install the `petersenlab` package:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_git("https://research-git.uiowa.edu/PetersenLab/petersenlab.git")
```

Once you have the `petersenlab` package installed, load the package:

```{r}
library("petersenlab")
```

To run scripts on the lab drive, set the path to the lab drive (`//iowa.uiowa.edu/shared/ResearchData/rdss_itpetersen/Lab/`) using the following code:

```{r}
petersenLabPath <- setLabPath()
```

# Load/install packages

The way to install a package in `R` is:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("packageName1")
install.packages(c("packageName1","packageName2","packageName3"))
```

The default way to load a package in `R` is:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library("packageName1")
library("packageName2")
library("packageName3")
```

However, when sourcing (i.e., running) other `R` scripts, it is possible that you will run scripts that use packages that you do not have installed, resulting in an error that prevents the script from running.
Thus, it can be safer to load packages using the lab function, `load_or_install(),` rather than using `library()`.
The `load_or_install()` function checks whether a package is installed.
If the package is not installed, the function installs and loads the package.
If the package is installed, the function loads the package.
To use this function, you must have the `petersenlab` package loaded.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
load_or_install(c("packageName1","packageName2","packageName3"))
```

For example:

```{r}
load_or_install(c("tidyverse","psych"))
```

# Set a seed

Set a seed (any number) to reproduce the results of analyses that involve random number generation.

```{r}
set.seed(52242)
```

# Run an `R` script

To run an `R` script, use the following syntax:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
source("filepath/filename.R")
```

# Render a `.Rmd` file

To render a `.Rmd` file, use the following syntax:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
render("filepath/filename.Rmd")
```

# Variable Names

To look at the names of variables in a data frame, use the following syntax:

```{r}
names(mydata)
```

# Subset

## One variable

To subset one variable, use the following syntax:

```{r}
mydata$age
```

## Multiple variables

To subset multiple variables, use the following syntax:

```{r}
mydata[,c("survived","age","prediction")]
```

## Particular rows

To subset particular rows, use the following syntax:

```{r}
mydata[c(1,3,5),]
mydata[which(mydata$survived == 1),]
```

# View data

## All Data

To view data, use the following syntax:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
View(mydata)
```

## First 6 Rows/Elements

To view only the first six rows (if a data frame) or elements (if a vector), use the following syntax:

```{r}
head(mydata)
head(mydata$age)
```

# Data Characteristics

## Data Structure

```{r}
str(mydata)
```

## Data Dimensions

Number of rows and columns:

```{r}
dim(mydata)
```

## Number of Elements

```{r}
length(mydata$age)
```

## Number of Missing Elements

```{r}
length(mydata$age[which(is.na(mydata$age))])
```

## Number of Non-Missing Elements

```{r}
length(na.omit(mydata$age))
```

# Create New Variables

To create a new variable, use the following syntax:

```{r}
mydata$newVar <- NA
```

Here is an example of creating a new variable:

```{r}
mydata$ID <- 1:nrow(mydata)
```

# Create a Data Frame

Here is an example of creating a data frame:

```{r}
mydata2 <- data.frame(
  ID = c(1:5, 1047:1051),
  cat = sample(0:1, 10, replace = TRUE)
)

mydata2
```

# Recode Variables

Here is an example of recoding a variable:

```{r}
mydata$oldVar[which(mydata$sex == "male")] <- 0
mydata$oldVar[which(mydata$sex == "female")] <- 1
```

# Rename Variables

```{r}
mydata <- mydata %>% 
  rename(newVar = oldVar)
```

# Merging/Joins {#merging}

Here is a visual that depicts various types of merges/joins:

## Full Outer Join {#fullJoin}

A full outer join includes all rows in $x$ **or** $y$.
It returns columns from $x$ and $y$.
Here is how to merge two data frames using a full outer join (i.e., "full join"):

```{r}
fullJoinData <- merge(mydata, mydata2, by = "ID", all = TRUE)

fullJoinData
dim(fullJoinData)
```

Or, alternatively, using `tidyverse`:

```{r}
full_join(mydata, mydata2, by = "ID")
```

## Left Outer Join {#leftJoin}

A left outer join includes all rows in $x$.
It returns columns from $x$ and $y$.
Here is how to merge two data frames using a left outer join ("left join"):

```{r}
leftJoinData <- merge(mydata, mydata2, by = "ID", all.x = TRUE)

leftJoinData
dim(leftJoinData)
```

Or, alternatively, using `tidyverse`:

```{r}
left_join(mydata, mydata2, by = "ID")
```

## Right Outer Join {#rightJoin}

A right outer join includes all rows in $y$.
It returns columns from $x$ and $y$.
Here is how to merge two data frames using a right outer join ("right join"):

```{r}
rightJoinData <- merge(mydata, mydata2, by = "ID", all.y = TRUE)

rightJoinData
dim(rightJoinData)
```

Or, alternatively, using `tidyverse`:

```{r}
right_join(mydata, mydata2, by = "ID")
```

## Inner Join {#innerJoin}

An inner join includes all rows that are in **both** $x$ **and** $y$.
An inner join will return one row of $x$ for each matching row of $y$, and can duplicate values of records on either side (left or right) if $x$ and $y$ have more than one matching record.
It returns columns from $x$ and $y$.
Here is how to merge two data frames using an inner join:

```{r}
innerJoinData <- merge(mydata, mydata2, by = "ID", all.x = FALSE, all.y = FALSE)

innerJoinData
dim(innerJoinData)
```

Or, alternatively, using `tidyverse`:

```{r}
inner_join(mydata, mydata2, by = "ID")
```

## Semi Join {#semiJoin}

A semi join is a filter.
A left semi join returns all rows from $x$ **with** a match in $y$.
That is, it filters out records from $x$ that are not in $y$.
Unlike an [inner join](#innerJoin), a left semi join will never duplicate rows of $x$, and it includes columns from only $x$ (not from $y$). 
Here is how to merge two data frames using a left semi join:

```{r}
semiJoinData <- semi_join(mydata, mydata2, by = "ID")

semiJoinData
dim(semiJoinData)
```

## Anti Join {#antiJoin}

An anti join is a filter.
A left anti join returns all rows from $x$ **without** a match in $y$.
That is, it filters out records from $x$ that are in $y$.
It returns columns from only $x$ (not from $y$).
Here is how to merge two data frames using a left anti join:

```{r}
antiJoinData <- anti_join(mydata, mydata2, by = "ID")

antiJoinData
dim(antiJoinData)
```

# Long to wide

Original data:

```{r}
fish_encounters
```

Data widened by a variable (`station`), using `tidyverse`: 

```{r}
fish_encounters %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = station,
              values_from = seen)
```

# Wide to long

Original data:

```{r}
mtcars
```

Data in long form, transformed from wide form using `tidyverse`:

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(),
               names_to = "variable",
               values_to = "value")
```

# Average Across Coders

Create data with multiple coders:

```{r, class.source = "fold-hide"}
idWaveCoder <- 
  expand.grid(
    id = 1:100,
    wave = 1:3,
    coder = 1:3,
    positiveAffect = NA,
    negativeAffect = NA
  )

idWaveCoder$positiveAffect <- rnorm(nrow(idWaveCoder))
idWaveCoder$negativeAffect <- rnorm(nrow(idWaveCoder))

head(idWaveCoder)
```

Average data across coders:

```{r}
idWave <- idWaveCoder %>% 
  group_by(id, wave) %>% 
  summarise(
    across(everything(),
      ~ mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE)),
    .groups = "drop") %>% 
  select(-coder)

head(idWave)
```

# Session Info

```{r, class.source = "fold-hide"}
sessionInfo()
```
